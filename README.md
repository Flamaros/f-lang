# f-lang
F programming language (just a learning project)

This project is only for personal purpose, my goal is to learn ASM and a bit about how creating a compiler from scratch.

## Goals
1. Windows platform
1. x64 architecture
1. No libc dependency
1. Bootstrap as soon as possible the compiler
1. Make the compiler fast

## TODO
1. Generate an exe at PE format with hard coded ASM code
1. Parse and generate ASM code for hello.f program
